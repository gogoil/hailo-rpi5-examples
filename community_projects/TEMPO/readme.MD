Requirements
------------

The packages are described in the requirements (additionally to the requirements of the whole repo)

Run Options
-----------
You can run either with a heart monitor which will choose the initial BPM in the generation or by choosing the generation manually. 

Setup
-----

1. Setup virtual environment
    - run `. setup_env.sh`
    - `cd community_projects/TEMPO`
    - `pip install -r requirements.txt`
    - `sudo chmod 777 download_files.sh`
    - `./download_files.sh`

2. Hardware Setup (for using heart monitor)
    2.1 Hardware Requirements:
        - Heart monitor - https://pulsesensor.com/
        - A2D - part number ADS1115
        - Jumpers to connect raspberry header to the sensor.
    2.2 Hardware Connections:
        2.2.1 Connect the hear monitor to the analog input A0 of the A2D.
            - Prepare the sensor according to the official site - https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0100/6632/files/PulseSensor_Datasheet_2024-Nov.pdf?v=1732032216
            - Connect red wire to 3.3V pin of A2D.
            - Connect black wire to ground pin of A2D.
            - Connect purple wire to A0 pin of A2D.
        2.2.2 Conect the A2D to the raspberry pi in the correct GPIO of I2C0. 
            - Image of pinout is availiable at https://community.element14.com/products/raspberry-pi/m/files/148385
            - Pin1 is 3.3V of the A2D.
            - Pin3 is SDA.
            - Pin 5 is SCL.
            - Pin 6 is Ground.
    2.3 Put the heart monitor on the your finger using the velcro tape provided in you purchase (see 2.2.1). 
        The tape should be strong enough to not fall from the finger but not too strong for a reliable read as the monitor uses the light reflection coming from the veins. 

Running the program
-------------------

1. Run the web application(not using heart monitor):
    - run `python app_hailo.py --port 8080 --batch 1`
    - After the web ui opens click "generate". This will load the hef file which is located in a google drive folder.
    - In this version you can control all the sliders.

2. Run using heart monitor:
    - run 'python app_heart_bit.py'
    - When running with the heart monitor, the music is then generated and then is played. 

Additional Notes
----------------

- On the heart monitor application, BPM measurements are printed for about 20 seconds, you can ignore them as the final result will be calculated on the whole 20 seconds. 
- If the heart monitor is not put correctly the BPM will be 0 for all measurements and the program will not work.
